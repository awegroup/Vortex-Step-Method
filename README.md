# Vortex Step Method
The Vortex Step Method (VSM) is an enhanced lifting line method that improves upon the classic approach by solving the circulation system at the three-quarter chord position, among the most important details. This adjustment allows for more accurate calculations of lift and drag forces, particularly addressing the shortcomings in induced drag prediction. VSM is further refined by coupling it with 2D viscous airfoil polars, making it well-suited for complex geometries, including low aspect ratio wings, as well as configurations with sweep, dihedral, and anhedral angles.

The software presented here includes examples for: a rectangular wing and a leading-edge inflatable kite.

A Julia version of this project is available at [VortexStepMethod.jl](https://github.com/Albatross-Kite-Transport/VortexStepMethod.jl)

**Machine Learning**

The code base is adapted to work with a machine learning model trained on more than a hundred thousands Reynolds-average Navier Stokes (RANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations made for leading-edge inflatable airfoils, documented in the MSc. thesis of (K.R.G. Masure)[https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:865d59fc-ccff-462e-9bac-e81725f1c0c9], the (code base is also open-source accessible)[https://github.com/awegroup/Pointwise-Openfoam-toolchain].

As the three trained models, for Reynolds number = 1e6, 5e6 and 1e7 are too large (~2.3GB) for GitHub, they have to be downloaded separately, and added to the `data/ml_models` folder. They are accessible trough (Zenodo)[10.5281/zenodo.16925759], and so is the (CFD data)[10.5281/zenodo.16925833] on which the models are trained. More description on its usages is found in [Airfoil Aerodynamics](docs/AirfoilAerodynamics.md).

## Usages
Please look at the tutorial on a rectangular wing, where the code usage and settings are fully detailed.
You can find it in `examples/rectangular_wing/tutorial_rectangular_wing.py`

Another tutorial is present under `examples/TUDELFT_V3_LEI_KITE/tutorial.py` where a geometry is loaded from .yaml, plotted, distributions are plotted and polars are created to demonstrate the effect of the stall model.
